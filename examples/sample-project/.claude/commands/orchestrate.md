# Orchestrate Command

Sequential agent workflow for complex tasks.

## Usage

`/orchestrate [workflow-type] [task-description]`

## Workflow Types

### feature
Full feature implementation workflow:
```
planner -> tdd-guide -> code-reviewer -> security-reviewer
```

### bugfix
Bug investigation and fix workflow:
```
explorer -> tdd-guide -> code-reviewer
```

### refactor
Safe refactoring workflow:
```
architect -> code-reviewer -> tdd-guide
```

### security
Security-focused review:
```
security-reviewer -> code-reviewer -> architect
```

## Execution Pattern

For each agent in the workflow:

1. **Invoke agent** with context from previous agent
2. **Collect output** as structured handoff document
3. **Pass to next agent** in chain
4. **Aggregate results** into final report

## Handoff Document Format

Between agents, create handoff document:

```markdown
## HANDOFF: [previous-agent] -> [next-agent]

### Context
[Summary of what was done]

### Findings
[Key discoveries or decisions]

### Files Modified
[List of files touched]

### Open Questions
[Unresolved items for next agent]

### Recommendations
[Suggested next steps]
```

## Final Report Format

```
ORCHESTRATION REPORT
====================
Workflow: [type]
Task: [description]
Agents: [agent chain]

SUMMARY
-------
[One paragraph summary]

FILES CHANGED
-------------
[List all files modified]

TEST RESULTS
------------
[Test pass/fail summary]

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
[SHIP / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED]
```

## Tips

1. **Start with planner** for complex features
2. **Always include code-reviewer** before merge
3. **Use security-reviewer** for auth/payment/sensitive data
4. **Keep handoffs concise** - focus on what next agent needs
5. **Run verification** between agents if needed
