# Library Friction Log

Aggregated friction reports across all internal and external libraries.

## Purpose

Track issues, limitations, and awkwardness with libraries to:
- Identify patterns across projects
- Make informed library decisions
- Discover opportunities for internal libraries
- Know when to replace dependencies

---

## Internal Libraries

*No friction reported yet*

<!-- Template:
### [library-name] - [date]
**Project**: [where encountered]
**Severity**: Minor | Moderate | Major
**Category**: Bug | Missing Feature | Documentation | API Design | Performance
**Description**: [what went wrong]
**Workaround**: [how you worked around it]
**Potential Fix**: [what would make this better]
**Status**: Open | Fixed | Won't Fix
-->

## External Libraries (npm/pip/etc)

<!-- Template:
### [package-name] - [date]
**Type**: npm | pip | cargo | etc
**Project**: [where encountered]
**Severity**: Minor | Moderate | Major
**Category**: Bug | Missing Feature | Documentation | API Design | Performance
**Description**: [what went wrong]
**Workaround**: [how you worked around it]
**Potential Fix**: [what would make this better]
**Replacement Candidate**: Yes/No - [suggested alternative]

## How to Report

Use `/report-friction` command in project, or manually add entry following templates above.

Project-level friction is tracked in each project's `FRICTION.md`. Significant or recurring friction should be copied here for cross-project visibility.
