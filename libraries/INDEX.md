# Library Index

Central catalog of available internal libraries.

## How to Use This Index

Before implementing common functionality:
1. Check this index for existing solutions
2. Review the library's LIBRARY.md for fit
3. Install or link as appropriate
4. Report friction if issues arise

## Friction Reports

See `libraries/FRICTION.md` for aggregated friction across all libraries.

When using a library, report issues via `/report-friction` command in your project.
